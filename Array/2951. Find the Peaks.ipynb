    "A \"**0-indexed array**\" refers to an array or similar data structure where the *first element* is accessed using the ***index 0***, the second element using the index 1, and so on. This is in contrast to \"**1-indexed**\" systems where the first element is accessed with index 1. \n",

    "- **Starting Index:** The index of the very first element is 0.\n",
    "    Subsequent Elements: Each subsequent element's index increments by one from the previous, meaning the n-th element is found at index n-1.\n",

    "- **Common in Programming:** Most modern programming languages, including C++, Java, Python, JavaScript, and many others, utilize 0-based indexing for arrays and lists.\n"
