    "#### **Hints**\n",
    "\n",
    "What is **`In-Place`**?\n",
    "\n",
    "**In-place** means modifying the data **directly in the original memory location**, without using extra space for another copy of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### In simpler terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "You **don't create a new array or list** — you just update or rearrange the elements in the existing one.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're given:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "nums = [0, 1, 0, 3, 12]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And your goal is to move the zeroes to the end **in-place**, you change `nums` directly to:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "[1, 3, 12, 0, 0]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "without doing something like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "new_nums = [1, 3, 12, 0, 0]  # ❌ This is not in-place\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Why is it important?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Saves memory.\n",
    "* Often required in coding interviews and competitions.\n"
