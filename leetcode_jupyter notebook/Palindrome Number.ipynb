    "#### **Intuition**\n",
    "\n",
    "When I first saw this problem, I immediately thought about how a palindrome number reads the same forward and backwardâ€”just like a palindrome word (e.g., \"madam\"). So, I realized that to check if a number is a palindrome, **I could** reverse the number and compare it to the original.\n",
    "\n",
    "**However**, the `follow-up` asked **not** to convert the number to a string, so I decided to work with the digits directly. My idea was to reverse the number mathematically, by extracting digits one by one from the end, rebuilding the reversed number, and finally comparing it to the original.\n",
    "\n",
    "* If both are the same, the number is a palindrome."

    "#### **Approach**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If the number is negative, return `False` because it can't be a palindrome(-121 is not equal to 121-).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Store the original number.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Reverse the number by repeatedly:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Taking the last digit using x % 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Appending it to the reversed number using reversed_x = reversed_x * 10 + digit.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Removing the last digit from x using x //= 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. After the loop, compare the reversed number to the original.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. If they match, return True; otherwise, return False."

    "### What does \"without converting to a string\" mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, you can turn a number into a string using `str()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example \n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 121 \n",
    "s = str(x) # s is now the string \"121\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "Then we could check for palindrome like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "return s==s[::-1] # True if the string is the same forwards and backwards\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "But our code does not do that.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of converting the number to a string, your code reverses the number mathematically using digits only.\n",
    "\n",
    "That means:\n",
    "* It works with integers, not strings.\n",
    "* It's more memory-efficient and faster in some case\n",
    "\n",
    "So \"without converting it to a string\" means:\n",
    "* You're checking if the number is a palindrome using math only- no `str()`, no slicing, just digits."
